# Satellite-Tracker-using-ESP8266
Track real-time satellite positions using an ESP8266 NodeMCU, a 16x2 LCD (non-I2C), and the N2YO API. This project displays live satellite data both on a physical LCD and a modern mobile-friendly web page hosted by the ESP. No servo motors. No cloud storage. Just real-time orbital data â€” simple, wireless, and powerful.
